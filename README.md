MERN app database to help school navigate financial solvability of new admissions

# Problem identified: 
School fees are paid in installment to help alleviate the burden on some parents.
But some parents choose to abuse that generosity by paying the first and second installment and never paying the rest. Then the following academic year, they just shift their children to another school and repeat the same scheme over there.
The new school welcome them with open not knowing anything of what befell the previous school they are coming from and fall for the same "scam".

# Solution:
Create a central database of students financial solvability where schools can check the financial solvability of new admissions. It doesn't mean that schools MUST reject new admissions if they are found on this platform. It just means that they know, they are aware of might happen and prepare accordingly.
